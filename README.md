# Pull Request Review Guide

## The guide

## :atom_symbol: This process contains a lot of details

This process is a nuclear power plant. We donâ€™t expect casual contributors to follow it.
By *we*, we mean Red Hat's python-maint team, which currently handles Python interpreter maintenance in Fedora.
If you're not in the team, you're certainly welcome to look how we do things and follow/improve this guide (or parts of it) if you want to,
but your time might be better spent learning other things :)
